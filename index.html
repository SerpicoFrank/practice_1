								by Shop. The acceptance of the Customer's order by Shop is expressly made conditional upon the
								Customer's assent to
								these Terms and Conditions which will prevail notwithstanding anything that may be stated to the
								contrary on the
								Customer's order. Shop reserves the right to vary any of these terms at any time and any
								subsequent orders placed by the
								Customer will constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied. Once a Customer order has been
								placed and accepted by
								Shop, the Customer agrees that the Customer has no right to cancel or vary the order at any
								time, unless agreed upon in
								writing by both parties.
